# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayush!

🎓 **Master’s in Electrical & Computer Engineering @ Illinois Tech**  
🤖 Passionate about **Robotics, Embedded Systems, and AI/ML** — the trio that powers next-gen intelligent systems.

I love building things that **sense, decide, and act**: from embedded hardware to optimized AI running on edge devices.

## ✨ Fun Facts
- I enjoy breaking ML models with adversarial attacks (and then fixing them).  
- I prefer projects where hardware + AI + control come together.  
- I believe every engineer should build at least one robot that moves on its own.
